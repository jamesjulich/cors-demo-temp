        <h1>CORS Demo</h1>
        <p>This demo makes a complex, cross-origin request to a trusted server (localhost:3000). So, the request is preflighted.</p>
        <p>Because the trusted server does not include CORS headers (which tell the browser to relax same-origin policy restrictions), the browser blocks this cross-origin request.</p>
